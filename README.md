Admin chooses:  - ⭐ **Show Current Branch** — View the current active branch (usually main).   - 🌿 **Switch to Branch** — Switch to any local or remote branch (e.g., origin/feature-xyz) to review team members’ changes.   - 🔄 **Fetch Remote Branches** — Update the list of branches from the remote repo (GitHub).   - 🔀 **Merge Team Branch into Main & Push** —     - Select a remote team branch (origin/branchname) to merge.     - Merge the chosen branch into main.     - Push the updated main branch back to GitHub (origin).     - Delete the merged remote branch from GitHub after successful merge.  After merge & deletion, team members pull the updated main branch on their local machines to get the latest integrated code.  ---  ### 🌿 Workflow for Custom Branch (.custom.qcommit)  Team sees limited options:  - ⭐ **Show Current Branch**   - 🌿 **Switch to Branch**  Custom branches are for local/experimental work, so no merging or pushing is available.  ---  ## [Team Collaboration Workflow](#team-collaboration-workflow)  # Team Collaboration Workflow — Step by Step — Ctrl+Shift+T / Cmd+Shift+6  ### Initial Setup & Cloning (Admin → Team)  1. Admin sends collaborator invitations to the team repository.   2. Collaborators accept the invitation.   3. Team member prepares to clone the repository:      - Check if the current folder is empty.      - **If the folder is NOT empty or is inside an existing .git repo, do NOT clone here.**      - Instead, create a new folder in the parent directory for cloning.   4. Team member copies the repository URL from the admin's repo.   5. Team member pastes the URL and clones the repository successfully.   6. After cloning:      - Press Esc once to go back in dialogs/menus if needed.      - Press Esc twice quickly (double Esc) to exit completely.      - Confirm exit when prompted to avoid accidental closure.  ---  ### Setting Up Custom Branch (Team Member)  7. Press Ctrl+Shift+Q (or Cmd+Shift+1) to open the custom branch menu.   8. Choose or create a custom branch — this creates the .qcommit/.custom marker locally.   9. Press Ctrl+Shift+T (or Cmd+Shift+6) to open the team Git action menu.   10. Switch to the desired branch for working on features or fixes.   11. Commit changes **only through** the Ctrl+Shift+T (or Cmd+Shift+6) menu.       - **Important:** Committing is NOT allowed via the custom branch menu (Ctrl+Shift+Q / Cmd+Shift+1).   12. After committing, the system automatically switches the branch back to main after approximately 5 seconds.  ---  ### Admin Workflow & Post-Commit Steps  13. Admin uses Ctrl+Shift+A (or Cmd+Shift+2) to manage branches with limited options for custom branches:       - Show Current Branch       - Switch to Branch   14. Team members pull the updated main branch from the remote repository.   15. After merging, team members are prompted to delete their custom branches locally because:       - Merged branches are no longer needed.       - Deleting branches frees their names for future use.   16. Team members may create new branches with the same name if necessary.  ---  ### Important Notes & Restrictions  - Cloning must be done **outside** any existing .git repository folders.   - .qcommit folders and marker files are used locally to track branch types.   - Commits must only be performed via the team Git menu (Ctrl+Shift+T / Cmd+Shift+6).   - The custom branch menu (Ctrl+Shift+Q / Cmd+Shift+1) does NOT allow committing.   - Use single Esc to go back in menus; use double Esc to exit with a confirmation prompt.  This step-by-step workflow helps keep the team’s Git workflow clean, avoids conflicts, and ensures admins maintain control over merges and branch management.  ---  # Resources & Next Steps  - Learn how to use QCommit in real-world scenarios   - See [How It Works – Step by Step](#how-it-works-step-by-step)  ---  # Developers  - 👨‍💻 **Sudeep Lamichhane**   - 👩‍💻 **Nishma Lamichhane**  ---  # Contributors & Support  - 🏢 [**Bitmap IT Solution**](https://www.bitmapitsolution.com)     _Early inspiration and project direction._  ---  # License  Licensed under the **LICENSE.md** — free to use for personal or commercial projects.   ❗ Modification or redistribution of any part of the source code is strictly prohibited without written permission from **Sudeep Lamichhane**  ---  # Support the Project  If **QCommit** saves your time or improves your Git workflow:  - ⭐ Star the GitHub repo   - 🐛 Report issues or suggest new features   - 📢 Share with your dev friends or team    ---  > ✨ Let **QCommit** handle the Git routine.   > 🚀 You stay focused and ship faster.
